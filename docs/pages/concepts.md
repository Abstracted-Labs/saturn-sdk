## Multisig

A multisig is basically a piece of code, that you can change with different calls. One implementation of it was used on GitArch, where each multisig is a repository, and to make changes you would need to create a `multisig call`.

The Saturn SDK allows you to create multisigs, make calls to them, vote on them, and more.
