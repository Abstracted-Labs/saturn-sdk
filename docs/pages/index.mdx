The Saturn SDK is a set of tools that allow you to build apps with Multisigs on chain.

## Quick Start

<div className="steps-container">

### Install

To install the SDK it's pretty simple, you can just install the package with your favorite package manager:

<Tabs items={["pnpm", "npm", "yarn"]}>
    <Tab>
```bash 
pnpm i @invarch/saturn-sdk
```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
```bash
npm i @invarch/saturn-sdk
```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
```bash
yarn add @invarch/saturn-sdk
```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Multisig

A multisig is basically a piece of code, that you can change with different calls. One implementation of it was used on GitArch, where each multisig is a repository, and to make changes you would need to create a `multisig call`.

The Saturn SDK allows you to create multisigs, make calls to them, vote on them, and more.


### Ready to Go!

Now, you can create your first Multisig and start using it! ðŸŽ‰
